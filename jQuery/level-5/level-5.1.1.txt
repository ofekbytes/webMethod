level 5.1 - Handling Events

-- Handling Events - 
   JQuery provides an efficient way to handle events. 
   Events occur when the user performs an action: "clicking" an element, "moving" the mouse, "submitting" a form. 
   When an event occurs on a target element, a handler function is executed.
   For example: handling the "click" event on an element with id="demo" and display the current date when the button is clicked. 

--- example: <"example-5.1.1.html"> - JavaScript example

    var x = document.getElementById("demo");
    x.onclick = function () 
    {
        document.body.innerHTML = Date();
    }


--- example: <"example-5.1.2.html"> - jquery example
 
    $("#demo").click(function() 
    {
        $("body").html(Date());
    });


-!- "onclick" in JavaScript is "click" in jQuery

-!- event handler - is event that fired/submited and execute a function
    (The function that is executed when an event is fired is called the event handler)

level 5.2 - Common Events

- most commonly used events:

-- Mouse Events:
--- click occurs - when an element is clicked.
--- dblclick occurs - when an element is double-clicked.
--- mouseenter occurs - when the mouse pointer is over (enters) the selected element.
--- mouseleave occurs - when the mouse pointer leaves the selected element.
--- mouseover occurs - when the mouse pointer is over the selected element.

-- Keyboard Events:
--- keydown occurs - when a keyboard key is pressed down.
--- keyup occurs - when a keyboard key is released.

-- Form Events:
--- submit occurs - when a form is submitted.
--- change occurs - when the value of an element has been changed.
--- focus occurs - when an element gets focus.
--- blur occurs - when an element loses focus.

-- Document Events: 
--- ready occurs - when the DOM has been loaded.
--- resize occurs - when the browser window changes size.
--- scroll occurs - when the user scrolls in the specified element.

--- example: <"example-5.1.1.html"> - "keyup" event handler

level 5.3 - on() method, off() method

- on() method - used to attach an event to the selected element.
-- example - on() method
    $( "p" ).on( "click", function() 
    {
        alert("clicked");
    });

--- example: <"example-5.3.1.html"> - on() method

-- Try It Yourself


-!- The on() method is useful for binding the same handler function to multiple events. 
    You can provide multiple event names separated by spaces as the first argument(click dblclick). 
   
    $( "p" ).on( "click mouseover", function() 
    {
        alert("clicked");
    });

- off() method - remove event handlers
-- example:
    $("div").on("click", function() 
    { 
        alert('Hi there!'); 
    }); 
    $("div").off("click");

--- example: <"example-5.3.2.html"> - off() method / remove event handler


-!- The argument of the off() method is the event name you want to remove the handler for.
