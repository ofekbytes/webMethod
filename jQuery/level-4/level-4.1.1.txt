level 4.1 - Manipulate DOM 


-- When you open any webpage in a browser, the HTML of the page is loaded and rendered visually on the screen.
   To accomplish this, the browser builds the Document Object Model (DOM) of that page, 
   which is an object oriented model of its logical structure.
   The DOM of an HTML document can be represented as a nested set of boxes:

-- dom.png

     [document]
         |  
       <html>
          |
     +-----+-----+
     |           |
   <head>      <body>
     |            |
     |         +-----+
     |         |     |
  <title>     <h1>  <h2>    

-- The DOM represents a document as a tree structure where HTML elements are interrelated nodes in the tree.
   Nodes can have child nodes. 
   Nodes on the same tree level are called siblings.
   jQuery traversing is the term used to describe the process of moving through the DOM and finding (selecting) 
   HTML elements based on their relation to other elements.

-- jQuery makes it easy to traverse the DOM and work with HTML elements.

level 4.2 - DOM Traversal

-- example:

    <html>
      |
      |
    <body>
      |
   +--+--+
   |     |
  <h1>  <h2>    


The <html> element is the parent of <body> and an ancestor of everything below it.
The <body> element is the parent of the <h1> and <a> elements.
The <h1> and <a> elements are child elements of the <body> element and descendants of <html>.
The <h1> and <a> elements are siblings (they share the same parent).

Summary
An ancestor is a parent, grandparent, great-grandparent, and so on.
A descendant is a child, grandchild, great-grandchild, and so on.
Siblings share the same parent.
Understanding the relationship between the DOM elements is important to be able to traverse the DOM correctly.
