level 4.1 - Manipulate DOM - 

-- When you open any webpage in a browser, the HTML of the page is loaded and rendered visually on the screen.
   To accomplish this, the browser builds the Document Object Model (DOM) of that page, 
   which is an object oriented model of its logical structure.
   The DOM of an HTML document can be represented as a nested set of boxes:

-- dom.png

-- The DOM represents a document as a tree structure where HTML elements are interrelated nodes in the tree.
Nodes can have child nodes. Nodes on the same tree level are called siblings.
jQuery traversing is the term used to describe the process of moving through the DOM and finding (selecting) HTML elements based on their relation to other elements.
jQuery makes it easy to traverse the DOM and work with HTML elements.
