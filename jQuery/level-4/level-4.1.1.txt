level 4.1 - Manipulate DOM 


-- When you open any webpage in a browser, the HTML of the page is loaded and rendered visually on the screen.
   To accomplish this, the browser builds the Document Object Model (DOM) of that page, 
   which is an object oriented model of its logical structure.
   The DOM of an HTML document can be represented as a nested set of boxes:

-- dom.png

     [document]
         |  
       <html>
          |
     +-----+-----+
     |           |
   <head>      <body>
     |            |
     |         +-----+
     |         |     |
  <title>     <h1>  <h2>    

-- The DOM represents a document as a tree structure where HTML elements are interrelated nodes in the tree.
   Nodes can have child nodes. 
   Nodes on the same tree level are called siblings.
   jQuery traversing is the term used to describe the process of moving through the DOM and finding (selecting) 
   HTML elements based on their relation to other elements.

-- jQuery makes it easy to traverse the DOM and work with HTML elements.

level 4.2 - DOM Traversal

-- example:

    <html>
      |
      |
    <body>
      |
   +--+--+
   |     |
  <h1>  <h2>    


The <html> element is the parent of <body> and an ancestor of everything below it.
The <body> element is the parent of the <h1> and <a> elements.
The <h1> and <a> elements are child elements of the <body> element and descendants of <html>.
The <h1> and <a> elements are siblings (they share the same parent).


Summary
<html> parent of <body> <h1> <h2>
<body> parent of <h1> <h2>
<h1> <h2> child of <body> 
<h1> <h2> are Siblings share the same parent <body>
<body> child of <html>

--- example: <"example-4.1.1.html">  - dom example
.
.
level 4.3 - DOM Traversal method available
.
.
-- parent() method - direct parent element of the selected element
-- parents() method - all ancestor elements of the selected element
-- children() method - all direct children of the selected element
-- siblings() method - all siblings elements
-- next() method - next siblings element
-- nextAll() method - all next siblings elements
-- prev () method - previous siblings element of the selected element
-- prevAll() method - all previous siblings elements of the selected element
-- eq() - method - element with a specific index number of the selected element
.
.
level 4.4 - DOM Traversal method

-- parent() method - returns the direct parent element of the selected element
--- example: <"example-4.1.2.html"> - parent() method

-- eq() method - used to select a specific element from multiple selected elements.
--- second <div> element (index 0 = 1)
    $("div").eq(1); //=2
--- example: <"example-4.1.3.html">  - Dom Elements Method
.
.
level 4.4 - Removing Elements

-- remove() method - remove selected elements from the DOM
-- example: <"example-4.1.4.html">  - remove() method

-!- remove() method - removes the selected element(s), as well as its child elements.
--- example:
---- remove second <p>
     $("p").eq(1).remove();

---- remove all <p>
     $("p").remove();


-- empty() method - remove the child elements of the selected element/s
-- example: <"example-4.1.5.html"> - empty() method - This removes all the child elements of the div, leaving it empty.

--- example: empty the second of the element with id "nav"
    var e = $("#nav").children();
    e.eql(1).empty();
